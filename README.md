# Housing-price-prediction-

## Overview
This project aims to develop and compare two different regressors to predict the price of the house based on 16 various features.the dataset employed in this project encompasses a comprehensive set of features related to housing characteristics, economic indicators, and geographical attributes. Collected from diverse sources.prior to model training, feature engineering ,rigorous preprocessing and cleaning procedures are executed to ensure data quality and relevance. Emphasis is placed on 14 key variables known to significantly impact house prices,

## Dataset Description
1. **Longitude:** A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west.
2. **Latitude:** A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north.
3. **Housing Median Age:** Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building.
4. **Total Rooms:** Total number of rooms within a block.
5. **Total Bedrooms:** Total number of bedrooms within a block.
6. **Population:** Total number of people residing within a block.
7. **Households:** Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block.
8. **Median Income:** Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars).
9. **Median House Value:** Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars).
10. 14. **bedroom_ratio:** The number of bedrooms per total rooms in the house
11. **<1H OCEAN	:** Whether the house is one hour away from sea/ocean
12. **INLAND:** Whether the house is inland or not
13. **ISLAND:** Whether the house is in an island or not
14. **NEAR BAY:** Whether the house is near a bay or not
15. **NEAR OCEAN:** Whether the house is near the ocean or not
16. **House holds rooms:** Whether the house is near a bay or not 


## Project Structure
1. **Data Partitioning:**
    - The dataset will be divided into two partitions: training and testing.

2. **Model Design:**
    - linear Regression
    - random forest

3. **Results and Metrics:**
    - The socre for every model
    - Plotting the perdecited vaules of the two models with target
